# Kaggle

This repository is dedicated to storage and shows my attempts to solve Kaggle Challenges and other activities using datasets for ML techniques.


So, since these projects are dedicated to studying, practice, and learning, there are a lot of things that can be upgraded and optimized in this notebook and some of the results from this dataset are just for fun.


Feedback and collaboration always is grateful, feels free to contact me.
