Data-Projects

This repository is dedicated to storing and showcasing my attempts to solve Kaggle challenges and other activities using datasets for machine learning techniques.

Since these projects are focused on studying, practicing, and learning, there are many aspects that can be improved and optimized in the notebooks. Some results from these datasets are just for exploration and fun.

Feedback and collaboration are always welcome. Feel free to contact me!
